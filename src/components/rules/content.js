    <ParagraphHeaderStyle>Event Schedule (UTC time zone)</ParagraphHeaderStyle>
    <SectionHeaderStyle>Who can participate?</SectionHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      We welcome all participants living in or coming from Greenland, Iceland,
      Faroe Islands, Scotland and Coastal Norway (counties bordering the
      Atlantic Ocean). Especially young people between 18 and 30 years of age
      are encouraged to join. All backgrounds are relevant - the main criterion
      about the North Atlantic Corona Challenge is your idea to combat the
      crisis!
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <SectionHeaderStyle>How are teams formed?</SectionHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      The teams will be formed by the organizers to ensure a good mix of
      backgrounds and skills. We would like as many transnational teams as
      possible, to enable good knowledge exchange. A team can consist of up to 5
      participants.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <SectionHeaderStyle>What are the challenges?</SectionHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>There are three overarching themes:
    Save Lives, Save Businesses, Save Communities. Under each, a number of
    challenges are suggested below, but we want to generate other ideas as well
    in response to the challenges our regions are facing. So creativity is very
    much encouraged!</DescriptionStyle>
    <ParagraphHeaderStyle>SAVE LIVES</ParagraphHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      Coronavirus is a threat not only to our physical health – especially for
      our most elderly and fragile citizens; it can also cause mental health
      issues and other illnesses as people are less likely to seek medical help
      during the Covid-19 pandemic. Lockdowns and isolations can be a real
      struggle to people in our most rural and remote areas.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      We need solutions on how to overcome long distances to access medical and
      social care; how to protect our most vulnerable people; how to address
      loneliness and mental health issues due to isolation; how to support
      families through lockdowns and abusive relationships during the pandemic.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <ParagraphHeaderStyle>SAVE BUSINESSES</ParagraphHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      The pandemic is having a real impact on our rural economies – our
      businesses, especially those in tourism, services and food and drink
      industries are struggling. The markets and supply chains are disrupted by
      closures and lockdowns. Small and micro companies and self-employed are
      unable to survive. Adapting to post-corona times will also be a challenge.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      We need solutions on how to operate a safe business whilst practicing
      social distancing; how to diversify and innovate; how to reconfigure
      premises and production lines to ensure safety in the new environment.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <ParagraphHeaderStyle>SAVE COMMUNITIES</ParagraphHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      Social distancing is preventing us from spending time with friends and
      families. Birthday parties and weddings are cancelled or postponed.
      Sporting activities and social events are banned. Schools and nurseries
      are closed. A lot of people are working from home and isolating.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      We need solutions on how to support citizens in rural areas with getting
      essential shopping; how to help parents working from home and balancing
      work, care and homeschooling responsibilities; how to support communities
      with their response to the pandemic.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <SectionHeaderStyle>What do I need to participate?</SectionHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      Participants will need to register online and have access to a computer
      with good Internet connection, to enable live streaming. Platforms such as
      Slack, Zoom and YouTubeLive will be used as main communication tools
      between participants, mentors, jury and organisers. For the project result
      each team will need to have access to their own YouTube channel (which is
      free to create).
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <SectionHeaderStyle>
      Where do I find the kick-off webinar and the final webinar?
    </SectionHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      Both the kick-off webinar and final webinar will be held on a dedicated
      YouTubeLive channel called North Atlantic Corona Challenge.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <SectionHeaderStyle>What is meant with mentoring?</SectionHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      Each team will be assigned a mentor who will assist you throughout the
      competition. Your mentor will contribute with his or her skills and
      experience and provide tips and advice on how to best structure and
      develop your idea. Each mentor will support 2-3 teams. You will
      communicate with your mentor through the communication tool ‘Slack’. There
      will be 3 checkpoints with your mentor throughout the 48 hours of the
      event. The checkpoints will be on Saturday at 12.00 and 17.00, and 11.00
      (UCT time zone) on Sunday.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <SectionHeaderStyle>
      How do participants deliver their solution?
    </SectionHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      The teams will be asked to produce their project result as a 2-minute
      video presentation and upload it on YouTube as well as on the ProposalPot
      (which is a system developed by Tökni) - along with some basic information
      about the project. Submission deadline is Sunday at 15:00 (UTC time zone).
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <SectionHeaderStyle>What if I need help?</SectionHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      Help and support is available before and throughout the event.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <SectionHeaderStyle>What are the judging criteria?</SectionHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      The jury will choose winners in accordance with three main criteria:
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <ParagraphHeaderStyle>Originality</ParagraphHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      The project needs to create new solutions or apply existing solutions in a
      new, innovative way.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <ParagraphHeaderStyle>Realistic</ParagraphHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      The project must be realistic in terms of the legal, technological and
      scientific aspects of the solution. It should be possible to realize the
      project within a few months (exceptions can be made for particularly
      impactful solutions with a long-term perspective).
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <ParagraphHeaderStyle>Impact</ParagraphHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      The project should make a real difference in the struggle to help local
      communities and/or companies in the North Atlantic region. It should make
      a significant positive change for a large number of people or for
      businesses particularly affected by the corona virus.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      <br/>
      In addition, the project should be demand-led and with a commercial
      potential.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <SectionHeaderStyle>Who owns the IP?</SectionHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      The IP developed through this competition will reside with the developers
      themselves.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <SectionHeaderStyle>Code of conduct</SectionHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      All participants are required to treat others (such as other participants,
      mentors, judges and organizers) with respect throughout the whole event.
      You are expected to behave professionally at all times. No harassment or
      inappropriate comments or behaviors will be tolerated and may result in
      disqualification.
    </DescriptionStyle>
    <SectionHeaderStyle>Photo Release Waiver</SectionHeaderStyle>
    <DescriptionStyle>
      By participating in the NACC, you hereby grant the organizers permission
      to use the photographs, video, or other digital media created throughout
      the event for marketing purposes.
